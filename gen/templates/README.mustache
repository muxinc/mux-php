# Mux PHP

Official Mux API wrapper for PHP projects, supporting both Mux Data and Mux Video.

[Mux Video](https://mux.com/video) is an API-first platform, powered by data and designed by video experts to make beautiful video possible for every development team.

[Mux Data](https://mux.com/data) is a platform for monitoring your video streaming performance with just a few lines of code. Get in-depth quality of service analytics on web, mobile, and OTT devices.

Not familiar with Mux? Check out https://mux.com/ for more information.

## Requirements

PHP 7.1 or higher.
Dependencies are managed using composer.

## Installation

We publish Mux PHP to [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/muxinc/mux-php). You should depend on Mux PHP by adding us to your composer.json:

```json
    {
        "require": {
            "muxinc/mux-php": ">=0.0.1"
        }
    }
```
Then install your dependencies:

```sh
    composer install
```

And then autoload in your code:

```php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Manual Installation

**PLEASE NOTE:** We don't really recommend manual installation and our ability to help if this route doesn't work is minimal. We include this mostly for purposes of completeness.

Download the files and include `autoload.php`:

```php
<?php
require_once('/path/to/{{packageName}}/vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Getting Started

### Overview

Mux PHP is a code generated lightweight wrapper around the Mux REST API and reflects them accurately. This has a few consequences you should watch out for:

1) For almost all API responses, the object you're looking for will be in the `data` field on the API response object, as in the example below. This is because we designed our APIs with similar concepts to the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) standard. This means we'll be able to return more metadata from our API calls (such as related entities) without the need to make breaking changes to our APIs. We've decided not to hide that in this library.

2) We don't use a lot of object orientation. For example API calls that happen on a single asset don't exist in the asset class, but are API calls in the AssetsApi which require an asset ID.

### Usage With Webhooks

At this moment, this SDK is not suitable for verifying webhook payloads, due to some incompatibilities in our API spec and our SDK generation tooling. We are working on resolving these issues, but for now you should only use this SDK for Mux's REST APIs.

### Authentication

To use the Mux API, you'll need an access token and a secret. [Details on obtaining these can be found here in the Mux documentation.](https://docs.mux.com/docs#section-1-get-an-api-access-token)

Its up to you to manage your token and secret. In our examples, we read them from `MUX_TOKEN_ID` and `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET` in your environment.

### Documentation note

Please note that our SDK and the API documentation are generated from our OpenAPI specification. Many of the examples in our specification have JSON strings representing the sample values.  Because of this, many of the API documentation examples use the `json_encode()` function to convert that JSON string into a PHP associative array. In your own code, you can skip that step and use an associative array directly, or create a new object using the appropriate model as shown in the example below.

### Example Usage

Below is a quick example of using mux-php to ingest a new Video in your Mux account.

```php
    // Authentication Setup
    $config = MuxPhp\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()
        ->setUsername(getenv('MUX_TOKEN_ID'))
        ->setPassword(getenv('MUX_TOKEN_SECRET'));

    // API Client Initialization
    $assetsApi = new MuxPhp\Api\AssetsApi(
        new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
        $config
    );

    // Create Asset Request
    $input = new MuxPhp\Models\InputSettings(["url" => "https://storage.googleapis.com/muxdemofiles/mux-video-intro.mp4"]);
    $createAssetRequest = new MuxPhp\Models\CreateAssetRequest(["input" => $input, "playback_policy" => [MuxPhp\Models\PlaybackPolicy::_PUBLIC] ]);

    // Ingest
    $result = $assetsApi->createAsset($createAssetRequest);

    // Print URL
    print "Playback URL: https://stream.mux.com/" . $result->getData()->getPlaybackIds()[0]->getId() . ".m3u8\n";
```

Be sure to also checkout the [examples directory](examples/):
* [Create an Asset, wait for it to become availiable, and print its playback URL](examples/video/ingest.php)

There's also example usage of every API call (also used for testing):
* [Video](examples/video/)
  * [Assets](examples/video/exercise-assets.php)
  * [Live Streams](examples/video/exercise-live-streams.php)
  * [Signing Keys](examples/video/exercise-signing-keys.php)
  * [Uploads](examples/video/exercise-uploads.php)
* [Data](examples/data/)
  * [Errors](examples/data/exercise-errors.php)
  * [Exports](examples/data/exercise-exports.php)
  * [Filters](examples/data/exercise-filters.php)
  * [Metrics](examples/data/exercise-metrics.php)
  * [Video Views](examples/data/exercise-video-views.php)
